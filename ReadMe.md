Hi everyone!
I have created a Git Profile Search Website, which searches each & every profile one has entered (provided, correct username is specified).
The result of the search is information like: Username, Date of Creation, Date of Last Update, No. of Repos, followers & following.

The best part of the project is that it has user SignUp & Login Options.
Hence, a user can only use the Profile Search Functionality if one has created an account or has logged in with the correct credentials.
(REMEMBER: Do not use your actual password while creating account.)

This project has been created using HTML, CSS, JS, Bootstrap, NodeJS, Express & MongoDB Atlas.
